### Background
_Goonj_ is an annual fest of UIET, Panjab University, Chandigarh. Each year in _Goonj_, _MagBoard_ (the literary club of UIET) hosts an event Treasure Hunt which is one of the many events hosted by the club. Till 2016, Treasure Hunt was hosted as an offline event. In 2017, as part of the club, I ideated and implemented an online solution for hosting the event online.  
 
### About Treasure Hunt
The goal of Treasure hunt is to solve certain number of riddles. Each riddle is related to certain venue or object inside the UIET campus. The team that solves maximum number of riddles wins!

### About the project
- Each team gets a login credentials and riddles are shown to them on the home screen. The solution to each riddle is a venue or object in the campus. The teams need to upload a picture of that venue/ object and write description about the same.
- These solutions are verified manually in the admin panel by the organizers. For each correct answer, an increment of +4 is done on the team's score. The score table is shown on the homepage to all the participants and spectators.

### Participation stats in the event
__27 teams__ participated in the event. Each team consisted of 3-4 members.

### Impact of this Project
- Technology driven, less effort consuming and time saving solution.
- The teams did not have to frequently come up to the organizers' location for getting their solutions verified. 
- Unlike every year, no crowd accumulated around the organizers.
- Transparency in score boards; bringing out the sense of competition.
